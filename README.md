# Safely handle passwords on your Mac

This repository will enable you to perform following actions:

- Encrypt any file (geneartes key)
- Decrypt any file (needs key)
- Copy login and password into clipboard
- Add new password
- Update existing password
- Remove pw

The app may either use config parser (config.ini) and store data there, 
or it may store data inside JSON files.

### Current Next steps:
- Set up config.ini
- Set up "get_pw" without encryption


### Maybe / Someday:
- Use toml? # python_pw_cli
